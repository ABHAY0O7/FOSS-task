IDEAS FOR PROJECT:
• There should be a question-and-answer platform where juniors can interact with their seniors.
• Many students will have common doubts regarding their colleges, which cannot get clarified from any of the platforms such as Google and Quora. But few students may feel a little uncomfortable talking to their seniors. So here comes the need, A platform where juniors can interact with the seniors and get rendered about the stuff related to their college.
• A website where questions would be asked, answered, followed, and upvoted.
HOW IT CAN BE WORKED:
• Juniors will come up with the questions.
• Juniors have access to ask questions and upvote. Only seniors will have access to answer the questions. This can be done by giving access according to the student IDs.
• Website should be designed in such a way that it accepts only relevant questions and avoids abusive words.
• The questions with more upvotes will be displayed on the home page.
